# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:

To study the problem statement ,SRS document and draw the UML diagram of library management system system

# SRS (Procedure):

A Library Management System UML Diagram represents the design of how different components of a library interact. It typically includes several types of UML diagrams. Here's a simple explanation of each, along with the most important one: the Class Diagram. Use Case Diagram Shows actors and system functionalities. Actors: Librarian, Member Use Cases: Search Book, Issue Book, Return Book, Add Book, Remove Book, Pay Fine Sequence Diagram (Example: Book Issue Process) Shows object interactions in time sequence:

Actor: Member

Objects: Library System → Book → Borrower Activity Diagram Describes the flow of activities (like issuing a book). 47 List of Programs:

i) Usecase Diagram

ii)Class Diagram

iii)Activity Diagram

iv)Communication Diagram

v)Package Diagram

vi)Sequence Diagram
